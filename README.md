# Approach
Recent research on person detection and pose estimation allows us to get robust measurments of where people are in video captured with low-cost cameras. From this, we should be able to generate useful reports on which areas are busiest and when, how do groups interact, and other similar metrics. 
# Quickstart
Run the ./example.sh script
