# Overview
This project seeks to provide a way to understand how spaces are used, with an initial focus on makerspaces

# Approach
Recent research on person detection and pose estimation allows us to get robust measurments of where people are in video captured with low-cost cameras. From this, we should be able to generate useful reports on which areas are busiest and when, how do groups interact, and other similar metrics.
